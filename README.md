<ol>
<li>streamline categories
<li>atm, b-cycle, parking , restrooms  (custom overlays approach), but stop would also be cool 
<li>final sweep to make sure first type is putting each place in correct category & if not, make special cases
<li>final sweep on google maps out of date data - ex: up down, racoon river forks, stich, new art gallery, HEV pantry, etc..
<li>turn points of interest off  or simplified
<li>special overlays for brenton, city hall, historical building, capitol
<li>sense of place/ directional indicators - overall inital orientation,  compass, & to indicators (possibly using predefined symbols)
